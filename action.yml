  # Custom registry authentication
  # NOTE: npm and JSR use OIDC trusted publishing - no tokens needed
  # NOTE: GitHub Packages uses the GitHub App token automatically
  custom-registries:
    description: |
      Custom registries with authentication (one per line).

      Format (one registry per line):
        https://registry.example.com/_authToken=<token>
        https://registry.example.com/_auth=<base64-credentials>
        https://registry.example.com/                          # Falls back to GitHub App token

      For reusable workflows, store the entire config in a secret:
        1. Create a repository secret (e.g., CUSTOM_REGISTRIES) containing:
           https://registry.example.com/_authToken=npm_abc123
           https://other-registry.com/_authToken=npm_xyz789

        2. Pass it to the action:
           custom-registries: $\{{ secrets.CUSTOM_REGISTRIES }}

      Note: npm/JSR use OIDC trusted publishing (no configuration needed)
      Note: GitHub Packages authenticates automatically with the GitHub App token
    required: false
    default: ""
